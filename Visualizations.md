# Analysis Visualizations
## Histograms
![Histogram](https://github.com/stgordillo/smoking_healthcare_python_project/assets/138537215/9de2e334-d5c6-4e4b-bdc6-aad6e2141eda)
Four histograms looking at the total counts of participants within certain categories. From left to right, top to bottom we have age, weight, height and BMI score
Visualization made using seaborn histplot()

## Boxplot
![Boxplot](https://github.com/stgordillo/smoking_healthcare_python_project/assets/138537215/93f7f7ab-25c6-45cf-942e-2b14fd9e8c17)
Boxplot using data for participant ages, genders and their systolic blood pressure numbers. I created age groups of roughly ten years to better visualize the data. Each side-by-side boxplot is seperated by gender 

## Bar Charts

Two bar charts. They both look at participant's smoking habits. The question asked if they smoked at least once in their lifetime with answers between "Yes", "No", "Don't know" and "Refused". The bars are seperated by gender and the first one looks at total count, while the second chart looks at percentage.

## Pie Charts
![Piechart](https://github.com/stgordillo/smoking_healthcare_python_project/assets/138537215/677e4eea-5dd2-4019-b7b7-05fe05ccbc0c)
Three pie charts. The first one is similar data to the above bar chart of percentage of smoking habits between genders. The second one looks at only participants that have smoked and their marital status. The third pie chart looks at participants that have smoked and their education level.
